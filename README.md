# LLMs From Scratch

This project follows the book "Large Language Models from Scratch" by Sebastian Raschka, which provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing large language models from the ground up.

## About the Book

"Large Language Models from Scratch" is a practical guide that helps readers understand the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) by building them from scratch. The book covers essential concepts, architectures, and implementation details of modern LLMs.

## Project Setup

This project uses `uv` for dependency management, which is a fast Python package installer and resolver.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `uv` package installer

### Installation

1. First, install `uv` if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install .
```

## Project Structure

The project follows the structure and implementations as described in the book, with each chapter focusing on different aspects of LLM development.

## License
